# Weather Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains a project for weather prediction using deep neural networks. The model utilizes historical meteorological data to forecast weather conditions, leveraging Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Project Explanation

The primary objective of this project is to predict weather conditions using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging a deep neural network, the model learns patterns and relationships within historical weather data to provide accurate forecasts. Key steps involved include:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for training the model.
2. **Model Design and Training:** A deep neural network architecture is implemented, focusing on capturing temporal and non-linear dependencies in the data.
3. **Evaluation and Testing:** The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics, and predictions are visualized to assess its accuracy.

This project showcases the potential of AI in meteorology, enabling better planning and decision-making based on accurate weather predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset, `weather.csv`, includes historical weather data with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. This data serves as the input for training and evaluating the model.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** A neural network architecture implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for accurate weather prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to ensure optimal performance of the model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Validation using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess prediction accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Dataset:** Place the `weather.csv` file in the project directory.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Weather_Forecasting.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Weather_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
3. **Modify Parameters:** Customize the model architecture or hyperparameters as needed in the notebook.

## Results

- The model achieves high accuracy in predicting weather conditions based on historical data.
- Visualization of predictions versus actual values for better interpretability.

### Visualizations

The project includes detailed visualizations to analyze the model's performance:
- **Loss Curves:** Showcasing training and validation loss to understand model convergence.
- **Prediction Plots:** Comparing actual vs predicted values for temperature, humidity, and other parameters.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlighting the most influential features in the prediction process.

Visualizations are generated and displayed within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Scope

This project can be extended in several ways:

1. **Incorporating Additional Features:** Integration of more meteorological variables, such as solar radiation and precipitation.
2. **Multi-step Forecasting:** Extending the model to predict weather conditions for multiple future time steps.
3. **Integration with IoT:** Using live data from IoT devices for real-time weather forecasting.
4. **Model Optimization:** Exploring other architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models, for improved accuracy.
5. **Deployment:** Deploying the model as a web or mobile application for wider accessibility.
