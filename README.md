# Weather Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains a project for weather prediction using deep neural networks. The model utilizes historical meteorological data to forecast weather conditions, leveraging Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset, `weather.csv`, includes historical weather data with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. This data serves as the input for training and evaluating the model.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** A neural network architecture implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for accurate weather prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to ensure optimal performance of the model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Validation using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess prediction accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Dataset:** Place the `weather.csv` file in the project directory.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Weather_Forecasting.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Weather_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
3. **Modify Parameters:** Customize the model architecture or hyperparameters as needed in the notebook.

## Results

- The model achieves high accuracy in predicting weather conditions based on historical data.
- Visualization of predictions versus actual values for better interpretability.
